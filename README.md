# TokenRaiser

TokenRaiser is an open-source project designed to create a fundraising page through tokens. This encompasses direct token donations and NFT mints. The project is an opensource & modular version of the website [savenovo.com](https://savenovo.com).

You can view a live demo on [tokenraiser.xyz](https://tokenraiser.xyz).

## How it works

TokenRaiser is a page allowing you to track the ETH balance of various wallets & contracts and compare them to a target funding goal, to show the funding progress relative to a given deadline. It allows to gather multiple parallel initiatives towards a common goal, and to create a sense of unity & emergency towards a cause.
